\section*{Executive Summary}
\paragraph{Proposed Method}

\paragraph{Details of the Approach}

\paragraph{Rationale and Result}

\section*{Contributions}
We divided the project into two parts: sensing and decision making. We agreed
to encapsulate our code in a way that it would require minimum interfacing
during code integration, which resulted in two individual files: chesspiece.py
and chessplay.py, whereas my\_agent.py calls the two files. This practice is to
ensure code readability in my\_agent.py.\vspace{6pt}\\
Since we both think the other partner's part is more difficult to implement,
we consider this project as equally contributed.

\paragraph{Liu ZHangqi} \textbf{FILL in HERE}
\paragraph{Ruoyang Xu} Responsible for the sensing part of the agent. Coded the
entirety of chesspiece.py, the python instantiation of the sensing model for
our agent. Notable contributions include: I wrote an available moves function
for all the chess piece at any position used for propagation of probability that
any piece is at any location, which is kept as 16 numpy matrices. The
chess.Board class is not used due to the immense number of boards I would have
instantiate to keep for each possibility (16 pieces $\times$ 8 $\times$ 8
chess.Board objects that each keeps a 8 $\times$ 8 chess board vs a 16 by 8 by
8 matrix). I wrote the move result update for extrapolating if any particular
chess piece is killed and/or at any particular position. I also wrote the
sensing decision process in that aims to acquire maximize information by
targeting the location with max entropy.
